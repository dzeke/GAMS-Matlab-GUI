# GAMS-Matlab-GUI
Build a GUI in Matlab to accept input data for a two-crop (eggplant and tomatoes) linear programming profitability problem, then use the wgdx, gams, and rgdx functions to pass the entry to GAMS, run the optimization model four times to examine model sensitivity to water use by tomato crops, and read GAMS results and plot them in Matlab.
